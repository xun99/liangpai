Due to time constraint and linker problem in my MacBook, I did not use
 batch processing to save memery usage, and I also did not use CodeExercise.h
 and CodeExercise.cpp to design interface and implementation. Instead, I used
 a simple main.cpp file to run everything.

 To run, use command line:
 clang++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o output

 To execute the compile output, run
 ./output 

 Total time used:
 1 hour 51 minutes
